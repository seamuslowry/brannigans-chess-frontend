# Brannigan's Chess

"In the game of chess, you can never let your adversary see your pieces." -Zapp Brannigan

## Running the Project

- This project is best run from the [core repo](https://github.com/seamuslowry/brannigans-chess)
- Build the container with `docker-compose build frontend`
- Run `docker-compose up frontend` to bring up the client
- You should now see the app exposed on `localhost:3000`
- Full behavior may not be available without the corresponding backend

## Goal

This is designed as a chess app in which each player can only see their own pieces. Taken pieces are visible to both players.

## End of Development

The project is no longer in active development, and the backend is no longer deployed to save on costs. It can still be run locally from the [core repo](https://github.com/seamuslowry/brannigans-chess).
